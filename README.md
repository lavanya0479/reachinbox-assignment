üìù Note:

- Use Gmail App Passwords for IMAP (not your login password).

- Ensure Elasticsearch is accessible and the index exists (emails).

- The Slack bot must be invited to the target channel.

## üß† Cohere AI Categorizer

Cohere AI is used to analyze the **email subject and body** and automatically categorize each message before indexing it into Elasticsearch.

---

### üß© Example Categories

- üí¨ *Interested*
- üö´ *Not Interested*
- üèñÔ∏è *Out of Office*
- üì¢ *Promotional / Marketing*

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è How it Works

1. When an email is fetched from IMAP, its **subject and text** are sent to Cohere for classification:

   ```ts
   const response = await cohere.classify({
     inputs: [email.subject + ' ' + email.text],
     examples: [
       { text: "I'm interested in your product, let's connect!", label: "Interested" },
       { text: "Not looking for this right now, thanks.", label: "Not Interested" },
       { text: "I'm out of office until next week.", label: "Out of Office" },
       { text: "50% off sale this weekend!", label: "Promotional / Marketing" },
     ],
   });
2. Cohere returns a label like "Interested" or "Out of Office".

3. The email is stored in Elasticsearch with an added field:
```ts
{
  "from": "sender@gmail.com",
  "subject": "Let's schedule a demo",
  "body": "Hi, I'm interested in seeing your platform in action.",
  "category": "Interested"
}
```
4. Slack and Webhook receive this category in their notifications.
